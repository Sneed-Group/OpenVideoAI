# OpenVideoAI


## How to.

1. Install dependencies. Run the relavent script.
2. Run either ```./make_video.sh``` followed by your topic OR ```make_video_premade_script.sh``` followed by the relative file path of a script you wrote.
3. Wait.
4. You made a video! Post it anywhere you please, just try and give me and whoever you source the script from credit. (The default is the Samantha Ollama model, so give credit to me and Ollama team!)

## NOTE

"Personal" scripts are made for me (Sparksammy/NodeMixaholic)
